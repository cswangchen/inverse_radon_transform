## Inverse Radon Transform ##

### Introduction/簡介 ###
"<i>Seeing is believing</i>"; "<i>Picture is worth thounsands of words</i>; "百聽不如一見". <br />
Those idioms describe how important an image (in medical field) is. In this repository, we would like to convert a sinogram to a fully reconstructed CT image. Assuming readers are already familiar with what sinogram and Radon Transform are, this repository attempts to reconstruct a CT sinogram using the following two popular methods:

<ol>
  <li /> Filtered Back Projection (<b>FBP</b>) </li>
  <li /> Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (<b>ART</b>) </li>
</ol>
